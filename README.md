Monopoly Game Prototype – Project Description

The Monopoly Game Prototype is a desktop-based Java application developed to simulate the fundamental mechanics of the classic board game Monopoly. Built using Java and Swing, the prototype demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts and modular design through classes such as Board, Dice, Player, and Square. Its primary objective is to provide a functional framework that replicates core gameplay elements while serving as a foundation for further development.

The prototype includes a graphical board interface, allowing players to move tokens across squares according to dice rolls. The Dice component generates randomized values, ensuring fair and dynamic movement. The Player class manages each participant’s state, including their position, balance, and property ownership. The Board and Square classes coordinate the layout of the game, enabling interactions such as purchasing properties and paying rent.

Though simplified compared to the complete Monopoly game, this prototype highlights essential game features such as turn management, player progression, and property transactions. It omits advanced rules such as auctions, mortgages, trading, and jail mechanics, keeping the focus on testing fundamental interactions.

From a development perspective, the project applies MVC-inspired design, keeping logic modular and maintainable. The prototype also emphasizes reusability and scalability, allowing new features like Chance/Community Chest cards or multiplayer networking to be added in later iterations.

Overall, the Monopoly Game Prototype demonstrates how complex real-world games can be modeled programmatically, offering a working base for testing ideas, improving gameplay logic, and eventually expanding toward a full-featured Monopoly implementation.
